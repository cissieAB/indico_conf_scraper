## Prof. Xiaowen Chu's work

---
- [Benchmarking2016](shaohuai2016benchmarking.md). Benchmarking Caffe, CNTK, MXNet, TensorFlow and Torch
with FCN (synthetic & real data), ResNet (CNN), AlexNet (CNN, S&R data) and LSTM on up to 4 GPUs.
- [ImageNet training 2018](tencent2018imagenet-training.md). Train ImageNet within 4 minutes with 3
techniques: 1) mixed-precision, 2) AlexNet model updates, 3) optimized all-reduce algorithm. The test platform includes
up to 2048 P40 GPUs.
- [AI performance and energy benchmarking 2020](wang2020AI-benchmarking.md). Benchmarked the performance and energy
efficiency of Intel CPU, NVIDIA GPU (V100), AMD GPU and TPU (v2, v3) with real DL workloads
and CUDA C++ kernels.
