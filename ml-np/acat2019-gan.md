First read on 10/22/2022. Don't quite understand though it only
 gets 6 pages.

The NN architecture is in Section 3, which seems to be FCs.
 The loss function and the stepping method look like to be in
 Section 1.1, which are not that clear (as well as the *"Cramer metric"*).

It's hard for me to understand the definition
of the "momentum"/"pseudo-rapidity" of the different particles, and
the statistics (likelihood, pion hypothesis, etc) in Section 2. Section
4 talks about the results and I did not get the logic beneath, either.
